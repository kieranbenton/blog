title: First Post!
---

First post to open a new chapter and start up the blog again. I was previously self-hosting and lost the mysql db containing
the content in a Azure VM mishap a couple of years ago. I could restore from backups but frankly the content was so out of date as to not really be worth
it.

So I've decided to start afresh using Github pages and to learn Jekyll and Ruby a little. I'll be posting for myself mostly - reminders as to how I've
fixed particular problems or researched particular topics. 

Whilst the topics could be anything, they're likely going to be related to technology we are utilising at [Kaizen Ticketing](http://www.kaizenticketing.com) (of which I am founder). Lots
of interesting problems to tackle there - and a stack, if not on the cutting edge then just behind it. So lots for me to learn as well :)
