title: About

My name is Kieran Benton. I'm an engineer, technology strategist &amp; team builder. I'm based in London with my family and am currently building a
sports ticketing system as part of my role as CTO of [Kaizen Ticketing](http://www.kaizenticketing.com/), but this blog, its content and opinions are my own. 

I'm not a big tech blogger or otherwise writer - this blog is mostly going to be for me so that I can write about problems I'm facing, so apologies for that.
Hopefully some of it might be useful for others and if nothing else it will be for me when I google for the same problem 6 months later! :)
